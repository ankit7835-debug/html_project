        <h2><b>Steven Paul Jobs</b></h2>
        <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman, inventor, and investor
            best known for co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman
            and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
            1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

            Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972
            before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later
            studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I
            personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the
            Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.

            Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
            interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the
            breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the
            desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple
            LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.

            In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John
            Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform
            development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its
            CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as
            Pixar.[3] Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading
            animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.

            In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible
            for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive
            to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think
            different" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store,
            iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.[4] In 2003, Jobs
            was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of tumor-related respiratory arrest in 2011;
            in 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Since his death, he has won 141
            patents; Jobs holds over 450 patents in total</p>


        <h2><b>Early life</b></h2>

        <hr>

        <div><b>Family</b></div>
        <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and
            Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Abdulfattah Jandali was born in a Muslim household
            to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the
            American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin.
            There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of Swiss-German descent whose parents owned a mink farm
            and real estate in Green Bay. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to
            Jandali's Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to
            San Francisco to give birth.[6]

            Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but
            they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold Jobs
            and his wife Clara. Paul Jobs, an American of German descent, was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington
            County, Wisconsin. After dropping out of high school, Paul Jobs worked as a mechanic, then joined the US
            Coast Guard. After he was discharged at San Francisco, Paul married Clara Hagopian of Armenian descent in
            February 1946 and they moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana, where Paul worked as a machinist and later as a car
            salesman. Since Clara missed San Francisco, she convinced Paul to move back. There, Paul worked as a
            repossession agent, and Clara became a bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple
            looked to adopt a child.[6] Since they lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the
            adoption papers, and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed
            with a different family, but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son's college
            tuition.[6][7]</p>




        <H2><b>Infancy</b></H2>
        In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church.[8] When Steve was in high school, Clara admitted to
        his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his
        life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so
        difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When
        Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware,[9] and later said that he had been
        deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his
        "adoptive parents", and he regarded them as his parents "1,000%". Jobs referred to his biological parents as "my
        sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."[10]



        <h2><b>Childhood</b></h2>
        <p>Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist,[12] several other jobs,[13] and then
            "back to work as a machinist". Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957,[14] and by 1959 the
            family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California.[15] Paul built a workbench in
            his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics". Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's
            craftsmanship "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he
            built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but I
            was eager to hang out with my dad."[16]

            Home of Paul and Clara Jobs, on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California
            The childhood family home of Steve Jobs on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, is the original site of
            Apple Computer. The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 2013.[17]
            Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently
            misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary
            School in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and
            instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son.[18] Jobs skipped the 5th grade and
            transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View, where he became a "socially
            awkward loner".[19] Jobs was often "bullied" at Crittenden Middle, and in the middle of 7th grade, he gave
            his parents an ultimatum: either they would take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.[20]

            The Jobs family was not affluent, and only by expending all their savings were they able to buy a new home
            in 1967, allowing Steve to change schools. The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos,
            California) was in the better Cupertino School District, in Cupertino, California.[21] The house was
            declared a historic site in 2013, as the first site of Apple Computer.[17] As of 2013, it was owned by
            Jobs's sister, Patty, and occupied by his stepmother, Marilyn.[22] When he was 13, in 1968,[23] Jobs was
            given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an
            electronics project.[24]</p>
